MULTI-MONITOR SETUP: In the package contents you will find an app called “DisableMonitor” from https://github.com/Eun/DisableMonitor. If you want to play on an external monitor, you must first disable the laptop internal monitor and then run the game. This only needs to be done the first time you launch the game. After that the game will always launch on that monitor.
